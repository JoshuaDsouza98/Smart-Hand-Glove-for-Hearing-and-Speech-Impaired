# Smart-Hand-Glove-for-Hearing-and-Speech-Impaired

### Approach
The approach involves the integration of flex sensors and an MPU6050 sensor with an Arduino Nano microcontroller to capture hand gestures and convert them into digital signals. These signals are then processed and classified using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, enabling the recognition of ASL gestures. 

### Methodology 
The methodology comprises data collection through sensors, data preprocessing to standardize and linearize the information, and the utilization of machine learning, specifically the SVM classifier, to classify and interpret the gestures based on the provided dataset. This process includes a training phase, learning phase, and testing phase to achieve an accuracy rate of 91% for real-time ASL gesture recognition.

### Insights
The research insights include the successful development of a glove-based system capable of accurate ASL gesture recognition. The study also suggests the potential to expand the system to include additional gestures beyond the ASL alphabet, enhancing its utility for communication in various contexts.

### Impact 
The impact of this project is the creation of a cost-effective, wearable communication device that can significantly improve the lives of individuals with hearing and speech impairments. It has the potential to bridge communication gaps, enhance employment opportunities, and contribute to a better quality of life for this community, ultimately making a positive societal impact.
